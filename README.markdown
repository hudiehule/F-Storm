# F-Storm

F-Storm is a Storm-based distributed framework that can utilize FPGA and the CPU resources at the same time to accomplish distributed stream processing in heterogeneous environments.

## About Storm

Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives for doing realtime computation. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, [is used by many companies](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Powered-By.html), and is a lot of fun to use!

The [Rationale page](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Rationale.html) explains what Storm is and why it was built. [This presentation](http://vimeo.com/40972420) is also a good introduction to the project.

Storm has a website at [storm.apache.org](http://storm.apache.org). Follow [@stormprocessor](https://twitter.com/stormprocessor) on Twitter for updates on the project.

## Storm Documentation

Documentation and tutorials can be found on the [Storm website](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Home.html).

Developers and contributors should also take a look at our [Developer documentation](DEVELOPER.md).
